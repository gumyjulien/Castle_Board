# Castle_Board
A simple strategic game made with JavaFX.

All the code is available in ./src/app and is seperated like this : 
  ./presentation containing all the view controllers
  ./workers containing all the workers used
  The main file for the view is ./presentation/MainView.fxml

The game can be started using the .jar file located in ./dist.

Note that the game is only available in French, but the rules are quite simple to understand.
Important : Java 8 is required to start the .jar file.
